// to connect to your database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
// For example, you might use gorm.Open() to connect to a PostgreSQL database.

// The function should return an error if the connection fails.
// In this example, we are just returning nil to indicate success.
// In a real implementation, you would handle the error appropriately.
